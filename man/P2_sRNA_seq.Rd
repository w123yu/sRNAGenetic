\title{Sequences of sRNAs from one species}
\format{
A dataframe containing numerous sequences of all sRNAs in "P2" (Maternal parent: Triticum turgidum). However, only 400 sRNAs are selected as test data due to the large data of sRNA.
}
\source{
Generated from the Triticum turgidum (AABB).
}
\description{
The first column of this data set is all sequences from one species for the data statistics
}
\details{
This \code{data.frame} is very useful for the functional demonstration of "srnapredata"
